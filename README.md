# NoteApp 📝

A simple and intuitive note‑taking application built with **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Material UI**. It allows you to create, edit, delete, search, and filter notes, with each note customizable by color. All your notes are automatically saved in the browser's `localStorage` – so your data persists even after you close or refresh the page.
